				<Paragraph

				>
					Momentable operates a fully integrated proprietary platform
					which provides users the technological means to view,
					explore, showcase, and manage, solely at the user’s
					discretion, to connections with other users to buy, sell or
					transfer digital block chain collectibles that provide
					access to certain utilities such as unique goods, services
					and experiences (the “Collectibles”). The Collectibles are
					non-fungible tokens or similar digital assets implemented on
					a blockchain network (such as the Flow blockchain), which
					uses smart contracts to connect to or otherwise be
					associated with certain information. <br />
					<br />
					Momentable does not provide blockchain wallet services, is
					not a crypto-currency exchange or broker, and Momentable is
					not a money service business or a financial institution.
					Momentable merely provides a technological platform that
					helps users explore Collectibles and bridge interactions
					with each other and Collectibles available on publicly
					available blockchains. We don’t maintain custodianship or
					exert control over the Collectibles or blockchains you may
					interact with as part of the Services, and Momentable is not
					party to any contract or agreement between you and any other
					users. <br />
					<br />
					The actual contract for purchase and sale of any
					Collectibles is directly between the seller and buyer of
					said Collectibles. Momentable is not a vendor of
					Collectibles, goods, services, or information, and is not a
					traditional auctioneer. While we may provide the ability to
					showcase Collectibles, as well as provide pricing, listing,
					sourcing, and other guidance in our Services, such guidance
					is solely informational and you may, at your own discretion,
					decide to follow it or not. <br />
					<br />
					Each user bears complete responsibility for authenticating
					the specifications, validity, and genuineness of the
					Collectibles that they may purchase from third-party
					merchants using the Services and we make no claims about the
					specifications, validity, purpose, or genuineness of users
					or Collectibles (and any content associated with such
					Collectibles) visible on the Services. <br />
					<br />
					In addition, while we may help facilitate the resolution of
					disputes between users, Momentable has no control over and
					does not guarantee the existence, quality, safety or
					legality of Collectibles listed on the Website or Apps; the
					truth or accuracy of sellers’ content or listings; the
					ability of sellers to sell items; the ability of buyers to
					pay for items; or that a buyer or seller will actually
					complete a transaction. <br />
					<br />
					While Momentable prohibits conduct and use of the Services
					that is in violation of any of the terms below, you
					understand and agree that Momentable cannot be responsible
					for the content posted on the Services. Momentable does not
					necessarily pre-screen any user content, but Momentable and
					its designees have the right (but not the obligation) in
					their sole discretion to refuse or remove any such content
					that is available via the Services. As such, you may be
					exposed to materials that is in violation of these terms.
					You agree that your use of the Services is at your own risk
					and liability, and that Momentable is released of any
					liability in connection with same. You are solely
					responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs
					under your account.

				>
					To make full use of the Services and purchase, sell or
					showcase Collectibles, you will need a functional blockchain
					address and the use of a third-party wallet that is operated
					and maintained by a separate service provider. Your user
					account on Momentable will be associated with the blockchain
					address you link to it and will be used to showcase the
					Collectibles for that blockchain address (and, if
					applicable, any content that may be associated with such
					Collectibles). By integrating your third-party wallet with
					your Momentable user account, you agree to comply with the
					terms of use of your third-party wallet service provider.
					Third-party wallets that integrate with the Momentable
					platform are not in any way managed, operated, or secured by
					Momentable, and Momentable does not have custodianship or
					control over the contents of the third-party wallet that
					integrates with the Services. Momentable disclaims any
					liability associated with the contents of a third-party
					wallet linked to your Momentable user account. We have no
					ability to secure, reclaim or facilitate the transfer of the
					contents of your wallet. Momentable makes no representations
					or warranties regarding how the Services will integrate with
					any specific third-party wallet. If there are issues with
					your third-party wallet, please contact the service provider
					of your third-party wallet directly.
					<br />
					<br />
					The security of your third-party wallet is solely your
					responsibility, and you should never share the credentials
					associated with your third-party wallet with anyone.
					Similarly, you should never share the credentials associated
					with your Momentable account with anyone. If your Momentable
					account, or third-party wallet linked to your Momentable
					account are compromised because of any act or omission by
					you or by others, we bear no responsibility and disclaim all
					liability for any such security compromise. You must
					immediately notify us if you suspect or are made aware of
					security issues related to the Services.

					Collectibles is solely as set forth by the applicable vendor
					or creator of such Collectible.
					<br />
					<br />
					From time to time, Momentable may need additional
					information and documentation from you. For example,
					Momentable may need your assistance to comply with the valid
					and lawful request of a government authority or regulatory
					body of any jurisdiction. Momentable may, in its sole
					discretion, temporarily or completely suspend your account
					and prohibit you from accessing the Services until such time
					as Momentable has evaluated the information or documentation
					that you have provided. Failure to provide accurate
					information in relation to such a request in a timely manner
					may result in Momentable refusing to restore your access to
					the Services.
					<br />
					<br />
					Momentable may, from time to time, interrupt your access to
					the Services for any reason whatsoever, including, but not
					limited to, maintenance, upkeep, repair, or any other
					actions that Momentable may, in its sole discretion, elect
					to execute, with or without notice.

					Momentable provides the technological platform that allows
					you to interact with public blockchains and explore
					Collectibles created by third parties. We are not
					responsible for and make no representations or warranties in
					relation to any third-party content visible through the use
					of our Services, including, without limitation, any content

					Additionally, for any Collectible visible on our Services,

					<br />
					<br />
					Collectibles may be subject to a contract directly between
					buyers and sellers with respect to the use of the
					Collectible or any content, goods, services or experiences
					associated with such Collectible. Momentable is not a party
					to any such contract, and such contracts are solely between
					the buyer and the seller of said Collectible. The buyer and
					seller are entirely responsible for the content of such
					contract, and for effectuating the execution of such
					contract. As a purchaser, you are entirely responsible for
					reviewing the terms of such contract, and you enter such
					contract at your own risk.
					<br />

					The Services may contain hyperlinks or access to external
					websites or applications operated by third parties (each a

					Services to a Third-Party Link, you will be subject to the
					terms of service and privacy policy of the Third-Party Link.
					Momentable has no control over Third Party Links, and is not
					liable or responsible for any Third-Party Links or

					(a) Entire Agreement. This Agreement, which incorporates the
					Privacy Policy and any other policy herein referenced,
					constitute the entire agreement between you and Momentable
					with respect to the subject matter contained herein and
					there are no other terms, conditions, representations,
					warranties, or collateral agreements, express or implied.
					<br />
					<br />
					(b) Amendments. Momentable may amend this Agreement without
					notice or consent at any time and from time to time by
					posting the amended terms on the Site thirty (30) days prior
					to the effective date of such amendments. We may notify you
					by email of any material amendments. You can determine when
					this Agreement was last revised by referring to the “LAST
					UPDATED” reference expressly provided above. Your continued
					access, downloading or use of our Services constitutes your
					acceptance of the amended terms. This Agreement may not
					otherwise be amended except through mutual agreement by you
					and an Momentable representative who intends to amend this
					Agreement and is duly authorized to agree to such an
					amendment.
					<br />
					<br />
					(c) Force Majeure. Any delay in the performance by
					Momentable of any duties or obligations hereunder will not
					be considered a breach of this Agreement if such delay is
					caused by circumstances beyond our reasonable control,
					including without limitation, acts of God, acts of
					government, floods, fires, earthquakes, civil unrest, war,
					acts of terror, strikes or other labor problems (other than
					those involving our employees), failures of common carriers
					(including Internet service providers), or denial of service
					attacks.
					<br />
					<br />
					(d) Assignment. Momentable may assign this Agreement and all
					your consents contained herein, in whole, or in part, at any
					time, with or without notice to you. You may not assign your
					rights or delegate your duties under this Agreement, either
					in whole or in part, without Momentable’s prior written
					consent in each instance. This Agreement will enure to the
					benefit of and be binding upon the parties to this Agreement
					and their respective successors, heirs and permitted
					assigns.
					<br />
					<br />
					(e) Non-Waiver. Our failure to exercise or enforce any right
					or provision of this Agreement shall not operate as a waiver
					of such right or provision. Waivers will not be effective
					unless in writing and duly authorized by an officer of
					Momentable.
					<br />
					<br />
					(f) Severability. The invalidity or unenforceability of any
					provisions of this Agreement shall not affect the validity
					or enforceability of any other provision of this Agreement,
					which shall remain in full force and effect.
					<br />
					<br />
					(g) Language. This Agreement was written in the English
					language. If this Agreement is translated into another
					language, the English language text shall in any event
					prevail. Unless the context otherwise requires, words
					importing the singular include the plural and vice versa,
					and words importing gender include all genders. Where the
					word “including” or “includes” is used in this Agreement, it
					means “including (or includes) without limitation”.
					<br />
					<br />
					(h) Governing Law. This Agreement is governed and
					interpreted pursuant to the laws of the Province of British
					Columbia, Canada and the federal laws of Canada applicable
					therein, without regard to principles of conflicts of law
					that would impose the law of another jurisdiction, and you
					agree to submit to the exclusive jurisdiction of the courts
					located within the Province of British Columbia, Canada. The
					foregoing will not limit Momentable’s right to enforce this
					Agreement in any other jurisdiction if reasonably necessary
					or advisable in our sole discretion.
					<br />
					<br />
					(i) Trial Waiver. You hereby irrevocably and unconditionally
					agree to waive any right you may have to a trial by jury, or
					commence or participate in any class action against us
					related to the Services and/or this Agreement.
